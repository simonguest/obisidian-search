# Obsidian Search

A simple workflow to search your Obsidian vault based on filename.

Use keyword "o" followed by filename to list matching files. Select a file to open in Obsidian.

Use keyword "od" to open today's daily note. (The daily note will be created if it doesn't exist).

## Prerequisites

This workflow requires the Obsidian Advanced URI community plugin to be installed and enabled.

This workflow does not modify any files in your vault, but you use at your own risk. This workflow is not affliated with Obsidian.
